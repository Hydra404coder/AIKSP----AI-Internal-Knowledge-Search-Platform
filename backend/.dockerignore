# DOCKERIGNORE - FILES TO EXCLUDE FROM DOCKER BUILD
# =============================================================================
#
# WHAT IS THIS FILE?
# Similar to .gitignore, this file tells Docker which files to SKIP
# when copying files into the container.
#
# WHY EXCLUDE FILES?
# 1. Smaller image size (faster builds and deployments)
# 2. Security (don't include secrets or sensitive files)
# 3. Prevent conflicts (don't copy local node_modules)
# 4. Faster builds (less files to process)
#
